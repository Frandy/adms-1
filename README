Requires bison, flex.  Tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 12.04.  Changes for other systems should probably be done in admsXml/CMakeLists.txt and admsXml/config.h.

To install:
cd ADMS
bash create_files.sh
mkdir cmake
cd cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make

admsXml and admsCheck should be in ADMS/cmake/admsXml

do not do parallel make (e.g. make -j2) until the bison generation is made safe.
